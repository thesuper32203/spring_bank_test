     * Payment Success Indicator (PSI) is a Payment Intelligence solution that uses Financial Institution (FI) data to help payment originators evaluate a consumer&#39;s ability to pay now and in the future within a given time period. PSI is for payment originators to assess a consumer&#39;s real-time FI account balance and historical FI account activities to help minimize ACH declines and enable payment originators to gracefully transition to alternative payment methods or schedules when payment settlement using ACH / Account-based payment is less likely. PSI may not be used for credit or insurance underwriting, employment or rental screening, or any other purpose(s) that would implicate the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other consumer reporting law.    _Supported regions_: ![ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://flagcdn.com/20x15/us.png)
